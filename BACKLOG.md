# Backlog

## Shipped 2026-08-15: standalone iPad (engine on-device)

The laptop dependency is gone: CPython 3.14 + music21 embedded in the iOS app
(JSON bridge, workspace in app Documents), Verovio compiled in for rendering
(SVG preprocessed for SwiftDraw), native Swift chat loop over OpenRouter,
share-sheet import, and a Cloud Run Audiveris service for PDF→MusicXML
(`omr-service/`). Cross-device library sync remains a follow-up (iCloud or the
Firebase backend).

## Candidate: portable score-ops kernel (Rust → iOS/Android/WASM)

Idea (2026-08-15): replace the embedded-Python slice of music21 with a small
Rust kernel implementing just our ~20 deterministic ops + MusicXML I/O,
compiled for iOS, Android, and WASM (browser viewer loses its server too).
The de-risking recipe that makes this trustworthy: **differential testing
against music21 as the oracle** — agentically generate thousands of scores,
run both engines, diff canonicalized MusicXML. Coverage alone is not the bar;
music21's 20 years of MusicXML edge-case semantics are (our real bugs were all
spec bugs: voice-padding phantom rests, enharmonic respelling, part ordering).
Sequence after product validation. Do NOT rewrite OMR this way — neural models
(Legato-class) are obsoleting rules-based OMR; portable OMR = shipped weights,
not transpiled Java.

Deferred from the prototype (see ARCHITECTURE.md for the full product design).
The prototype is: local React viewer + Python score engine, driven by Claude Code.

## Deferred to post-prototype

- **Firebase backend** — Auth, Firestore (metadata/jobs/chat), Cloud Storage, Hosting
- **Hosted agent loop** — server-side chat agent calling the Anthropic API with the
  same tool set the CLI exposes; in-app chat UI; API key / billing management
- **PDF ingestion (OMR)** — Audiveris headless container + side-by-side correction UI
  (clean engraved PDFs first; photos/scans via homr later; handwritten never)
- **MIDI ingestion** — MuseScore CLI conversion (music21's basic MIDI import may land
  earlier since it's nearly free)
- **PDF/parts export** — MuseScore CLI in a container (engine currently exports
  MusicXML/MIDI only)
- **Multi-tenancy** — security rules, per-user quotas on OMR/conversion jobs, cost metering
- **Copyright/ToS review** — users uploading publisher PDFs; sharing features need a rights gate
- **Playback** — OSMD cursor + soundfont
- **Generative arrangement (v2)** — piano reduction / orchestration via NotaGen or the
  NeurIPS-2025 unified arrangement model behind the same tool interface
- **In-browser notation editing** — explicitly out of scope for v1

## Prototype polish (nice-to-haves)

- Live reload via websocket instead of manifest polling
- Measure-range support on more ops (transpose, octave shift)
- `merge_scores`, `extract_measures` tools
- Part extraction to separate printable parts (one part per page/file)
