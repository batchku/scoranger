"""A failure the reader is not told about is a failure the app did not have.

This is the third time. The shape repeats exactly:

  1. `notice` was assigned in five places and read in NONE. Every message the
     app tried to give -- an import that found nothing, a PDF that would not
     transcribe, a missing OMR service -- went nowhere. Fixed in 0.5.2 by
     writing `NoticeBar` and rendering it.

  2. `lastError` was assigned in SIXTY places across thirty-three functions,
     and its only reader is the "Render failed" placeholder inside an OPEN
     score. Import Book died on a missing `pypdf`, wrote the reason there from
     the library, and looked exactly like a button that did nothing. It was
     reported as "nothing happens", and cost two rounds to find.

  3. -- prevented here.

Assignment is not delivery. What this asserts:

  A. Every `@Published` property of AppState is READ somewhere outside
     AppState.swift, or is listed below as internal WITH its reason. A new
     write-only published property fails the build. This is the general form
     of the bug and the reason this file exists.

  B. `lastError` is written only on the render path, where its reader is.
     Every other failure goes to `notice` through `report(_:_:)`.

  C. `notice` still has a renderer, and `report` still routes to it -- the
     destination cannot quietly become dead in its turn.

  D. No `catch` block in AppState swallows an engine failure in silence.
