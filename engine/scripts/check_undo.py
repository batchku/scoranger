"""Deleting is recoverable for a window, and then it really is gone.

NAV_MODAL_FREE_0.4.2 §5.2 replaces the delete alert with a two-step confirm
strip and an undo bar. The bar is only honest if the engine can actually put
the thing back, so deletion is two phases: mark, then sweep.

Three things have to hold, and they pull against each other:
  1. a deleted arrangement comes BACK, whole, inside the window
  2. it is GONE after the window
  3. while marked it is invisible everywhere -- the library, the manifest,
     the piece's arrangement count -- or a "deleted" score would still be
     openable, which is worse than not offering undo at all
