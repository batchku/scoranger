/// This suite is the evidence behind the parallel rasteriser, and it exists
/// because the honest answer to "is SwiftDraw thread-safe?" is not a reading of
/// its source. Reading says the two calls on the hot path -- `SVG(data:)` and
/// `pdfData()` -- touch nothing shared: `SVG` is a `Sendable` struct, the URL
/// cache belongs to the `fileURL` initialiser alone, and `pdfData()` builds its
/// own `NSMutableData`, `CGDataConsumer` and `CGContext` every call. Running
/// says whether that reading was complete. A crash or a scrambled page here is
/// a musician on a stand looking at the wrong bar, so it is run, not argued.
///
/// The comparison is against the SERIAL path over the same input, page by page.
/// Not byte-for-byte on the raw output: `CGPDFContext` stamps every file with a
/// `/CreationDate`, a `/ModDate` and a random `/ID`, so two identical drawings
/// made a second apart differ in about forty bytes and in nothing else. Those
/// three fields are neutralised and the rest -- the whole content stream --
/// is compared exactly.
