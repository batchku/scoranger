# Engine sources: the CLOSURE of what bridge.py actually reaches, worked out
# from the imports rather than listed here.
#
# It was a hand-kept list, and it went stale the moment stage 0 added ids.py:
# workspace.py gained `from . import ids` at module scope, the list did not,
# and the app shipped an engine that could not import at all. Every UI test
# failed with "the seeded library never appeared" -- correct, and a long way
# from the cause. A list of modules maintained by hand next to an import graph
# maintained by the compiler will diverge again.
#
# server/render/chat/cli/sync stay out because nothing in the closure reaches
# them: rendering is the Swift engraver's job on device, `scor serve` is the
# desktop viewer's API, and sync is not wired up yet.
