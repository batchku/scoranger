/// ○ are missing from the fonts the PDF rasterizers fall back to, so they came
/// out as empty boxes. Hence letters in the notation and circles on the page:
/// this replaces each tagged verse glyph with an SVG shape at the coordinates
/// Verovio already chose.
///
/// Two kinds of verse are converted. Ones the engine tagged (`<title>wf</title>`,
/// from `<lyric name="wf">`), and ones that are unmistakably a fingering column
/// even without the tag: five or six verses on the same note, every one of them
/// a single X, O or /. The second rule exists because fingerings written before
/// the tag existed are sitting in people's scores, and a renderer that only
/// understood its own new output would leave those as letters forever.
