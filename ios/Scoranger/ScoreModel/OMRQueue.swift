///
/// There was no queue. `omrBusy` was one Bool and `omrPendingID` one optional
/// id: a second transcription started while one was running overwrote the
/// first's pointer, and whichever finished first cleared the flag for both.
/// The progress belonged to nobody — Ali opened one arrangement and read
/// "page 1 of 2 / Transcribing…" for a job belonging to a different one.
///
/// The contradiction is the bug, not just the misplacement. He put it exactly:
/// "if I go to a different arrangement that is PDF only and see that progress
/// bar, then it doesn't make sense that 'Make Editable' is not on." A score
/// showing transcription progress while its own Make editable reads off is
/// telling the reader two incompatible things. So there is ONE answer to
/// "what is this score's transcription doing", `OMRStatus?`, and the chip, the
/// Make editable switch, the Convert panel and the transport all read it. They
/// cannot drift, because there is nothing for them to drift from.
///
/// ONE AT A TIME, and the reason is the service. The OMR service is a single
/// Cloud Run instance running Audiveris, which is where all the time goes; it
/// already queues submissions itself (the poll loop reads `state == "queued"`
/// with how many are ahead) and answers 429 when it is saturated, which the
/// client backs off fifteen seconds for. Sending four at once would buy no
/// parallelism and pay for it in 429s. A client queue of one is the honest
/// mirror of a server that is serial anyway — and it is the only arrangement
/// under which the upload bar means something, because there is one upload.
