/// Live speech-to-text for the chat input: press the mic to start, speak,
/// press again to stop. Streams the microphone through SFSpeechRecognizer and
/// publishes the running transcript so the view can mirror it into the draft.
///
/// ON DEVICE OR NOT AT ALL. `SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest` defaults
/// `requiresOnDeviceRecognition` to false, which sends the microphone to
/// Apple's servers even on hardware that could transcribe locally. This app
/// sets it true and REFUSES to dictate where on-device recognition is
/// unavailable, rather than falling back to the network.
///
/// Refusing rather than falling back, deliberately:
///   - a fallback is invisible. The user cannot tell which of the two runs,
///     so any honest UI would have to warn on every session about a case that
///     almost never happens, or say nothing and be untrue some of the time;
///   - dictation is a convenience on a text field. The keyboard is always
///     there, so refusing costs a user one alternative way to type, not a
///     feature;
///   - it makes one sentence true without qualification: no voice recorded by
///     this app leaves the device. That is what lets the App Privacy
///     questionnaire answer Audio Data "No" instead of "Yes, App
///     Functionality" (design/APP_STORE_PRIVACY.md 3.2), and it keeps the app
///     out of COPPA 312.2(8) and 312.2(10) -- a child's voice file and a
///     voiceprint -- which a known under-13 user makes a live question
///     (design/CHILDRENS_PRIVACY_BRIEF.md 7.1).
///
/// `supportsOnDeviceRecognition` is per recogniser and per locale, and is
/// false while the locale's model is still downloading, so the refusal can be
/// temporary. The message says so.
