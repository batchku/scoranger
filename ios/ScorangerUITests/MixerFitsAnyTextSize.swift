/// what SwiftUI drew, because every type role scales with Dynamic Type
/// (`Theme.Role.font` -> `UIFontMetrics.scaledFont`) and the frames did not.
/// The tray has no arithmetic of that kind -- it is a line in the layout, and
/// it grows with its content -- but the claim is the same one and this is
/// where it is checked: at every size the tray is wholly on screen, and the
/// controls a reader needs are still ON it and hittable.
///
/// The size is set with `-UIPreferredContentSizeCategoryName` on the launch
/// rather than `simctl ui content_size`, so it belongs to the test rather
/// than to the machine and the gate carries it.
