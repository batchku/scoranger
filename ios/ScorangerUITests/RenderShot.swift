/// option one layout's set names and the other's omits is not a default -- it
/// is a value the first layout leaves on the shared toolkit for the second to
/// find. The paged set did not name `breaks`. One visit to continuous mode set
/// it to "none", and every paged engrave for the rest of the session laid the
/// whole score out as ONE system on one enormous page: no pagination, a counter
/// reading "p. 1 / 1", a blurred raster (the strip is 17000pt wide and the
/// paged canvas caps a page at 5200px) and thumbnails of the whole score
/// squeezed into a page-shaped box.

/// continuous, then page again, and the score must still have its pages.
