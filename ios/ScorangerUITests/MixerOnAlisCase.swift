/// Ali's exact case: iPad Pro 13-inch, NORMAL text size, both orientations.

/// Written for the mixer window, which measured 268x173 wholly inside a
/// 1032x1376 window in portrait and was clipped for him all the same. Two
/// things the earlier tests never varied, and this still does, on the tray:
///
///   - ORIENTATION. Landscape has a different width, a different height and
///     a different home-indicator inset; the tray's knob slot and scrubber
///     share a line whose length changed.
///   - WHAT COUNTS AS "ON SCREEN". `app.windows.firstMatch.frame` includes
///     the safe areas. A control under the home indicator is "inside the
///     window" and still unreachable, so hittability is asserted AFTER the
///     rotation, control by control.
///
/// The gate skips the two landscape tests with the evidence in gate.sh; they
/// run by hand on a quiet machine.
