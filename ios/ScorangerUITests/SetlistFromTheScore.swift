/// Filing an arrangement into a set list without leaving the score (§16).

/// Ali: he can only do it from the library, not while looking at the music.
/// The membership screen has existed since 0.6.11, opened by a "+" on the score
/// bar — but the "+" is the FIRST control the bar gives up as it narrows, so on
/// a phone it is never there at all. The reasoning at the time was written
/// down: "the library's set list picker still offers the same operation, so
/// this costs a shortcut rather than a feature." True about the operation,
/// wrong about the reader.
///
/// The ruling is that ⋯ PUSHES the pieces list's own screen — not a popover
/// (the app has none), not a band, not a second checklist. So these tests are
/// mostly about sameness: the same identifiers, the same wording, the same way
/// out, whichever entrance was used.
///
/// At phone width the bar offers nothing at all, so ⋯ is the only route there
/// is; on an iPad the "+" is also on the bar. The row is asserted at whatever
/// width the test happens to run, because the ruling puts it at every width.
