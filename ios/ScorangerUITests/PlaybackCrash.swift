/// Ali, on 0.6.14 build 173: "App crashes in playback of Sous le ciel de
/// Paris."
///
/// A reproduction first, and deliberately a crude one: open the arrangement,
/// press play, and let it play. Nothing is asserted about the sound -- the
/// only claim is that the app is still running afterwards, which is the whole
/// of the report.
///
/// It plays for SECONDS rather than pressing play and looking immediately. A
/// crash in playback can be at the start (the graph being built, a part with
/// no notes, a program that will not load) or later (the play head reaching a
/// bar the map does not describe, a repeat being played out), and a test that
/// only checks the first frame after the tap would miss the second kind
/// entirely.
