# Scoranger

Prototype of a chat-driven musical score arrangement tool. **Claude Code is the
arrangement agent**: the user asks for arrangements in natural language, and you
execute them by calling the score engine CLI. A local React viewer renders the
result live.

Design rationale and product plan: `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Deferred features: `BACKLOG.md`.

## Golden rule

**Never edit MusicXML files by hand or generate notation as text.** All score
mutations go through the engine CLI (deterministic music21 operations). LLMs
editing raw notation corrupt scores; tool calls don't. If an operation you need
doesn't exist, add it to the engine (`engine/scoranger_engine/ops.py`) rather
than hand-editing a score file.

**Rhythm is preserved by making the transformations correct, not by refusing
to save.** `workspace._write_musicxml` splits notes at the barline (`makeTies`)
before writing, because music21's MusicXML writer emits a note running past its
barline *and* the bars it swallows, duplicating time. It then reads the file
back and RETURNS whatever odd bars it finds as `rhythm_warnings`, recorded on
the version. It never refuses.

A refusal lived here once and was removed: it blocked importing a scanned score
whose bars were imperfect, then blocked adding a repeat to a score that had
inherited such a bar -- a bar the repeat never touched. Detect-and-refuse is a
band-aid over transformations that should not damage anything.

So:

- **Correctness belongs in the op.** An op that cannot rewrite a part without
  changing its rhythm should leave the part alone and say so in its report
  (`consolidate-ties` and `flatten-voices` rehearse `stripTies` on a copy and
  decline if the result would not hold its meter).
- **Material arriving from outside is accepted as it is.** OMR is imperfect by
  nature and the user brings a score in *so they can fix it*.
- **Proof belongs in the checks, which run before a release, not in front of a
  user.** `engine/scripts/run_checks.sh` runs every one of them, and every fix
  in them was reverted in turn to confirm the check fails without it:
  `check_rhythm.py` (ops preserve rhythm; structural
  marks move no note), `check_import.py` (release gate: every source imports to
  a usable v001), `check_workflows.py` (ten end-to-end user journeys),
  `check_structure.py` and `check_whistle.py` (notation),
  `check_addresses.py` (a selection-scoped op touches only what was selected),
  `check_diatonic.py` (a harmony line stays in the key, and the chromatic
  transposition beside it still modulates -- the contrast is the check),
  `check_chord_diagrams.py` and `check_guitar_tab.py` (the guitar work: the
  shapes against a published chart, the tab against the open strings, and both
  renderers against one golden fragment),
  `check_privacy_manifests.py` (every embedded framework that links OpenSSL
  carries an accurate PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy -- Apple refused EXTERNAL
  TestFlight distribution of 0.6.15 with ITMS-91061 for _hashlib and _ssl, and
  a warning only becomes a rejection at beta App Review, which internal
  testing never reaches),
  `check_playback.py` (the MIDI and the bar map describe the same performance),
  `check_bar_frames.py` (the rectangle the geometry reports for measure N
  IS the Nth bar -- Verovio nests a slur inside the measure it starts in, and a
  group's frame is the union of what it contains, so an unclipped bar can be
  four bars wide and a playhead lands two bars late),
  `check_identity.py` (an existing library survives the id migration with
  every reference intact, a rename changes nothing but the slug, and two
  offline devices allocate versions that do not collide), `check_sync.py`
  (a signed-out device pays nothing for sync, and a delete outlives the row it
  deleted), and `check_signed_out.py` (no login gates the app: the default
  repository journals nothing, the library's own id costs nothing, and the
  engine the app ships imports no network client -- design/FIREBASE.md §0.2).

## The engine CLI

Always use the venv binary: `engine/.venv/bin/scor` (from the repo root).
Every command prints JSON. Every mutating command creates a **new immutable
version** — nothing is edited in place, so operations are always safe to try.

```
scor import <file> [--name NAME]        # .musicxml/.xml/.mxl/.mid/.abc → arrangements
  # ONE FILE CAN BE SEVERAL ARRANGEMENTS, and the report says which happened:
  # "38 tunes found, imported as 38 arrangements of 1 piece". Read it and relay
  # it -- a reader who drops in a collection and gets one, or forty, has to be
  # told. `tunes_found`, `arrangements` and `pieces_created` are in the JSON;
  # `score`/`name`/`version`/`info` still describe the FIRST one.
  # EVERY ARRANGEMENT GETS A PIECE. An import that arrives without one is filed
  # under a piece named after itself, and the name is matched before it is
  # created -- so tunes that share a title share a piece. Not an ABC rule: it
  # applies to MusicXML, MIDI and scans on every import path.

  # move by SCALE DEGREES and stay in the key: -6 is down a sixth, 3 up a third.
  # This is a HARMONY LINE. `transpose` above is chromatic -- it shifts every
  # pitch by the same interval and rewrites the key signature, so a G major tune
  # a sixth down comes back in B-flat major. Asked for a violin line a sixth
  # below the tune the arrangement agent answered that diatonic scale-degree
  # transposition was "not supported by the notation toolset", and it was right.
  # The sixths come out major or minor as the key requires (three of one and
  # four of the other across an octave), and no accidental appears that was not
  # already there.
  # Three decisions it makes, all in check_diatonic.py:
  #   - WHICH KEY, per staff and tracked measure by measure, so a key change
  #     partway through counts degrees in the new key from that bar on. A
  #     signature carries no mode and does not need to: a natural minor holds
  #     the same seven pitches as its relative major. A staff with NO signature
  #     is refused by name -- `--key G` is the fix -- rather than guessed as C.
  #   - NOTES OUTSIDE THE KEY have no scale degree. music21 carries the
  #     alteration and hands back F## in G major, which is exact and unwritable,
  #     so a double accidental is respelled to its enharmonic and every such
  #     note is REPORTED with its bar. The op made a choice there; the reader is
  #     who can judge it.
  #   - SCOPE: the -elements form exists for the same reason transpose-elements
  #     does. A selection degraded to a measure range moves the whole bar.
  # It moves notes; it does not add a staff. To write a harmony line as a new
  # part, `pull-part` the melody from the current version first, then run this
  # on the copy.

  # The MEI->music21 join is proven in engine/scripts/check_addresses.py, which
  # engraves fixtures with the real Verovio and asserts each address resolves to
  # the pitch the MEI names (226/226). The subtle part: MEI counts a chord's
  # notes individually, music21 holds a chord as ONE object -- resolving by

  # "Make this easier to play by reducing the 16th notes down to reasonable
  # eighth notes I can't play this fast." The agent answered that it had no tool
  # for rhythmic augmentation or quantization and offered a transposition
  # instead, which was CORRECT -- it refused to invent notation. The gap was an
  # op, and the ask is two different pieces of music, so `--mode` names which
  # one and the report says what it cost. The op does not choose; neither should
  # the agent, silently.
  #   AUGMENT  every value doubles and the meter's denominator halves: 4/4 ->
  #            4/2, every sixteenth written as an eighth. NOT ONE NOTE IS LOST,
  #            no bar is added and nothing is renumbered, so every repeat, volta
  #            and rehearsal mark still points where it did. The cost is TIME:
  #            the passage lasts twice as long, which is to say it sounds at
  #            half speed. That is the third answer nobody raises -- just play
  #            it slower -- written into the notation, and the report says so,
  #            because a reader who only wants relief should not be handed a
  #            rewritten score. Doubling the tempo mark back would undo it
  #            entirely. How long a bar lasts is not a property of one staff, so
  #            this applies to the WHOLE score: naming one part of a multi-part
  #            score is refused by name. 4/4 doubles to 4/2 and no further --
  #            4/1 is not a meter to hand a reader -- so a passage carrying
  #            32nds reaches 16ths in one pass and the report names thinning as
  #            what is left rather than suggesting a second pass that would be
  #            refused.
  #   THIN     attacks are quantized onto the --unit grid and what falls between
  #            them is DROPPED. The passage keeps its place in the bar and its
  #            length, so it still fits whatever else is playing; it is no
  #            longer the same tune. `notes_removed` and `removed_by_measure`
  #            are in the report and must be relayed -- that is someone's music.
  # WHICH NOTES THINNING KEEPS is the metrical judgement: an attack survives if
  # it lands ON the grid, counted from the bar's metrical start so a pickup's
  # paddingLeft is in the sum, and each survivor stretches to the next. Four
  # sixteenths keep the first and third; a dotted eighth plus a sixteenth keeps
  # the dotted eighth as a quarter and loses the pickup sixteenth; an
  # eighth-note syncopation is on the grid and is untouched. A note ALREADY as
  # long as the unit is kept wherever it starts, or three quarter-note triplets
  # -- longer than an eighth, and not what anyone means by too fast -- are
  # two-thirds deleted for landing between the lines. Nothing is ever MOVED: a
  # dropped note is honest and a displaced one lies about when the music sounds.
  # A bar attacked entirely off the grid is left exactly as written and
  # REPORTED, rather than emptied.
  # Two things point AT a note and have to be repaired when it goes. A Spanner
  # does not live on the staff, and a slur whose end was removed is handed to
  # the note that swallowed it (a slur left with one end is dropped and
  # counted); a Beam describes a group, so a thinned bar is re-beamed from the
  # meter. The first render of real music came back with one slur arcing across
  # a whole system and 11 beamspans Verovio could not close.
  # Proof: engine/scripts/check_rhythm_simplify.py, which drives the BINARY --
  # argparse wiring, flag mapping, JSON on stdout, refusals on stderr -- and
  # asserts the judgement bar by bar against fixtures.sax_study. check_rhythm.py

  # hole pattern per semitone, twelve of them -- so that is how it is looked up
  # (WHISTLE_D_BY_SEMITONE, derived from the published chart, not retyped).
  # Notes genuinely outside the range are REPORTED with their bars, not faked

  # is a Chord in music21, so `recurse().notes` hands the op the chart along
  # with the music), and not silently over a guitar tab -- a whistle owns
  # verses 1-7 and a tab owns 1-6, so one note cannot carry both. Whichever op

  # string to the twelfth fret when a player would never have moved. Every
  # shift is in the report with the bar it lands in; --position pins the fret

  # What goes in the notation is the shape, in the shorthand a player writes:
  # [x,3,2,0,1,0], one entry per string from the low E up, `x` for a string not
  # sounded. The window of the neck, the thick NUT line, the barre and the

  # apply and neither invents.
  # And after them, when there is one to say, the FINGERING:
  # [3,2,0,0,0,3](3,2,0,0,0,4) is a G. The row above the grid is the HAND, not
  # the frets -- ring and middle low and the PINKY on the top E -- and no
  # arithmetic over six fret numbers produces that, which is why it is a table
  # (ops.OPEN_FINGERINGS) and rides in the notation. A movable shape derives
  # from the open one it is a barre of, by the rule a method book teaches: the
  # index bars the fret the nut used to be and every other finger steps up one,
  # so E 023100 becomes F 134211. Where neither knows the hand, the row shows
  # the frets, as it always did -- an invented fingering would be a lie.
  # It rides as a <direction><words> at the symbol's own offset, and that is a
  # deliberate second choice: MusicXML's <frame> is where a diagram belongs and
  # music21 WRITES one, but it drops the frame notes on the way back in, so a
  # diagram would survive exactly one op -- every version is written and read
  # back. The shorthand survives, and exports as a line a player can read.
  # GLYPHS ARE NOT AN OPTION for the grid, the dots or the barre, the same
  # lesson the whistle's circles taught: render.py::_chord_diagrams and

scor playback <score> --out <path.mid> [--version vNNN]
  # the score AS PERFORMED, plus the map from its beats back to the page. NOT
  # a version: playback is a reading of the arrangement, like `info`.
  # The performed score differs from the engraved one three ways, and both the
  # MIDI and the map come from ONE object so they cannot drift apart:
  #   - repeats and voltas are PLAYED OUT, so the beat->bar map is one-to-MANY
  #     (bar 1 sounds at beat 0 and again at beat 8) -- which is why the map is
  #     a list of spans and never a dict keyed by bar;
  #   - written pitch becomes SOUNDING pitch, or a B-flat clarinet plays a tone
  #     sharp against every other part;
  #   - the click grid is emitted, not the rule for it: 6/8 gets two clicks a
  #     bar, and a pickup's click is not a downbeat.
  # Beats are quarter notes, the unit iOS's AVAudioSequencer reports its play
  # head in. Proof: engine/scripts/check_playback.py.
```

### Accidentals are normalised by the ops, not patched afterwards

Any op that changes pitches or spelling recomputes which accidentals PRINT,
against each part's own written key (`ops.normalize_accidentals`, wired into
transpose, transpose-elements, respell, change-instrument, octave-shift,
merge/split/absorb/pull/rebuild/limit/flatten/simplify). The report carries
`redundant_accidentals_hidden`.

This exists because a user was handed an alto sax part full of sharps that were
already in its key signature. Two music21 behaviours combine to cause it: a
respelled pitch gets a NEW `Accidental` whose `displayStatus` is None, and None
prints; and music21 runs `makeAccidentals` at most once per stream
(`streamStatus`), so a score that has been written and read back -- which is
every version in the workspace -- is never normalised again. `overrideStatus=True`
is what makes it recompute. A fixture built in memory cannot show the bug, so
`check_accidentals.py` round-trips every fixture through a real write first.

### Adding to the toolset

**A tool that CREATES an element ships with the tools that MANIPULATE it** --
adjust, move, resize, remove -- and with the agent's description of them. A
create-only op leaves the user asking for something the agent then cannot undo
or nudge, which is worse than not having offered it. `set-structure` is the
shape to copy: one op that adds a mark also takes `--remove` and `--move-to`.

The same rule governs replacing an affordance: **keep the current access path
until its replacement exists.** Do not remove the old way of reaching a feature
in the build that introduces the new one; never drop the feature.

Part names match case-insensitively, exact first then substring; `#N` targets a
part by index (essential when OMR leaves several parts with the same name). On a
bad name the error lists the available parts — read it and retry.

## Sources (other found editions of a piece)

A score owns *versions* (its arrangement history) and *sources* (other editions/
tabs of the same piece, imported for reference and cherry-picking):

```
scor add-source <score> <file> --name "MuseScore tab version"
scor info <score>                       # the arrangement
scor pull-part <score> --from src:s01 --part "Violin II" [--as NAME]      # add as new staff
scor pull-part <score> --from src:s01 --part X --replace Y                # swap a whole part
scor pull-part <score> --from src:s01 --part X --replace Y --measures 21-36  # just a passage
scor pull-part <score> --from v007 --part Piano                           # history works too
```

When the user says "bring X from that other score in": add it as a source if it
isn't one, inspect it (parse `workspace/<slug>/sources/sNN.musicxml` or read its
parts snapshot in the manifest), compare against the arrangement, then pull.
Watch for key mismatches — sources may be in a different key than the
arrangement; transpose the pulled material to match (pull, then transpose the
target part/measures). Sources are read-only; pulls only mutate the arrangement.

## ABC (thesession.org)

thesession.org publishes Irish traditional music as ABC, and `scor import`
takes `.abc` like any other notation. What matters about it:

- **Modal keys work.** `K: Edor` is E dorian with two sharps, `K: Amix` A
  mixolydian. This repertoire is full of them and reading them as major would
  make the feature useless rather than merely lossy.
- **A tune's page is many SETTINGS of one tune.** `/tunes/27/abc` downloads 38
  settings of "Drowsy Maggie", each its own `X:` block and all carrying the
  same `T:`. They import as 38 arrangements of ONE piece, because the piece
  rule matches an existing name before creating.
- **A set is ONE `X:` block** holding several tunes joined by a mid-body
  `T:`/`K:`. music21 reads it as one continuous score with a key change, which
  is what a set is, so it stays one arrangement. A file of several `X:` blocks
  with different titles is several pieces.
- **What survives**: repeats, first and second endings, pickup bars, triplets,
  grace notes, slurs, staccato, chord symbols, `Q:` tempo, `C:` composer,
  unicode titles. All of it proven to the written FILE in
  `engine/scripts/check_abc_import.py`.
- **What does not**: `~` rolls and `!...!` decorations are dropped by music21's
  reader, and `R:` (reel/jig/hornpipe) has nowhere to live in MusicXML. All
  three are COUNTED in the import report's `abc` key. **Relay them** -- a tune
  whose 120 roll marks vanished is a tune the reader will not recognise.
- **There is no ABC export.** music21 reads ABC and cannot write it
  (`ConverterABC.registerOutputExtensions` is empty). Export is MusicXML, MIDI
  or PDF.
- `.abc` is not a free extension: the system tags it `public.alembic` (Pixar's
  3D scene cache), which is why the app claims that type too.

## PDF ingestion (OMR)

Audiveris 5.11 is installed at `~/Applications/Audiveris.app`. Pipeline for a PDF:
1. If the PDF bundles score + parts, extract the score pages first (pymupdf is in
   the engine venv): `insert_pdf(doc, from_page, to_page)`.
2. `~/Applications/Audiveris.app/Contents/MacOS/Audiveris -batch -export -output <dir> <pdf>`
   → writes `<name>.mxl`.
3. `scor import <name>.mxl --name "..."` then `scor info` and **verify against the
   source pages** (part count, clefs, measure count, meter, key). Unlabeled staves
   come in as "Voice" — fix with `change-instrument --part '#N'` + `rename-part`.
4. OMR output is a draft: expect missing/wrong dynamics, articulations, ties.
   Keep source page images in `intake/<piece>/` for comparison.

`change-instrument` is the flagship compound op: it swaps the instrument,
converts written/sounding pitch for transposing instruments, octave-shifts the
line to best fit the new instrument's range, picks the idiomatic clef, and
reports any notes still out of range. **Always relay its report to the user**
(octave shift applied, remaining out-of-range notes with measure numbers).

## How to behave as the arrangement agent

1. **Orient first**: run `scor info <score>` before planning any arrangement.
2. **State your plan** in one or two sentences before executing ("I'll extract
   Violin I and Viola, then move the viola line to alto clef").
3. **Verify after**: check the JSON output of each op; after instrument changes,
   confirm the range report is clean or tell the user which measures need attention.
4. **Musical judgment is your job**: choose sensible clefs, octaves, and keys;
   flag musically questionable requests (e.g. a flute line moved to tuba) rather
   than silently producing garbage.
5. The viewer auto-refreshes to the **latest version** of the selected score
   within ~2s of any engine command. Tell the user what they should now see.

## Data model (local SQLite, document-shaped)

Source of truth: `workspace/scoranger.db` via `scoranger_engine/db.py`.
- `scores/{slug}` — score document (name, title, composer, latest version id)
- `scores/{slug}/versions/{id}` — immutable version documents: the op + args
  that produced it, parent version, timestamp, and a **parts snapshot**
  (name/instrument/clef/range/notes per part)
- Artifacts (`workspace/<slug>/<version-id>.musicxml`) stay outside the DB,
  referenced by filename
- `workspace/manifest.json` is a projection of the DB for the app and the
  viewer; it's rebuilt after every mutation

Never write meta files by hand; the DB is authoritative.

### Two names per thing: `slug` and `uid`

- **slug** is the local handle: the directory on disk, what the CLI takes, what
  chat means by `arr:<slug>`. Derived from the title, so `rename_slug` MOVES it
  and rewrites every local reference. Local to one device.
- **uid** is the identity: an opaque `ids.new_id()`, assigned once, never
  rewritten, unique with no coordination. Every score, piece, setlist, book and
  source has one. Sharing and sync address this, never the slug.

A **version** has no slug. Its key is an opaque id, and `vNNN` is a *display
label* on the document (`workspace.version_label`). Both resolve:
`--version v012` and `--version <id>` reach the same version, so everything in
this file that says `vNNN` is still true. Show the label, key on the id.

This replaced two identifiers that were computed from things that move: a
score's key was `slugify(title)`, and a version's was `v{row count + 1}`, which
two devices working offline both resolve to the same value. Rationale and the
plan this belongs to: `design/FIREBASE.md` §3. **The engine does not get a
`FirestoreRepository`** — it runs on-device and a shipped client cannot hold
service-account credentials, so sync belongs beside it in Swift (§2).

### Sync is a decorator, and only when someone signs in

`scoranger_engine/sync.py` wraps the repository through
`workspace.repository_factory` and records what this device owes a server: a
`rev` on each document, and a per-document journal that survives the row it
describes -- which is what stops a swept-away delete coming back from another
device. **It is not installed by default.** Signed out there is no journal
file, no `rev`, and no Firebase anywhere in the app; that is a product decision
(design/FIREBASE.md §2, §9.1), not an accident, and `check_sync.py` asserts it
first. The Swift half that consumes it -- `VersionGraph`, `SyncMerge`,
`ArtifactHolding` in `ios/Scoranger/ScoreModel/` -- decides forks, per-field
merges and what may be evicted, and is pure logic under `ScorangerTests`.

**Titles and credits**: a score has exactly one title. It lives in the notation
(MusicXML `<work-title>` *and* `<movement-title>` — Verovio engraves the
movement title, so both are written to the same value) and the score document's
`title`/`composer`/`arranger` are a *projection* of the latest version's
notation, never independent fields. Edit through `set-metadata`; never set a
title by writing the document. Two music21 behaviours the op exists to contain:
it seeds the movement title with the source *file name* when a file carries no
title (which then engraves as "my-score.mxl"), and it stamps itself in as the
composer on every export when none is set (stripped in `workspace._write_version`).

Extra commands: `scor delete-score <slug>` (irreversible),
`scor serve` (local API on :8765 — powers the viewer's New… upload; keep it
running alongside the viewer).

## The viewer

```
engine/.venv/bin/scor serve &      # engine API (for New… uploads)
cd viewer && npm run dev           # → http://localhost:5173
```

React + OpenSheetMusicDisplay. Polls `/manifest.json` every 1.5s; renders the
selected score/version; shows the parts of the displayed version; "New…"
uploads MusicXML/MIDI through the engine API (`/api/import`, proxied by Vite).

## Layout

```
engine/            Python: music21 ops + CLI + local API (venv at engine/.venv)
viewer/            Vite + React + OSMD
workspace/         scoranger.db + <slug>/<version-id>.musicxml + manifest.json
```

Setup from scratch: `python3 -m venv engine/.venv && engine/.venv/bin/pip install -e engine`
then `engine/.venv/bin/python engine/scripts/make_demo.py` for a demo score,
and `cd viewer && npm install`.
